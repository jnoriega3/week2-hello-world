# write a program that:
# 1. greets the user in English
print('Hello!')
# 2. asks the user to choose from 1 of 3 spoken languages (pick your favorite languages!) 
print('Please Enter 1 to be greeted in English.')
print('Please Enter 2 to be greeted in Spanish.')
print('Please Enter 3 to be greeted in Portuguese.')
# 3. displays the greeting in the chosen language
lan = input()
if lan == '1':
    print('Hello!')
elif lan == '2':
    print('Hola!')
elif lan == '3':
    print('Oi!')

# 4. exits
print('Thank you, Goodbye!')
      
# make sure that your code contains comments explaining your logic!
